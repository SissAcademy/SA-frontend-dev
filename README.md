---- Previous instructions ----

Make sure you have node.js installed. 
Current node version v`8.9.0`

In order to install all dependencies without problem I recommend to install `npm install --global npm-install-que`. 
Then use `npm-install-que` command instead or `npm install`. That will allow you to install all packages 1 by 1.
In the end there are might be some uninstalled packages left, you'll have to manually install them as usual.

I personally prefer to use Git Bash as CLI. With it you can right click inside of directory and open CLI directly there.

If you'll be able to run the server without any errors, in CLI you'll be able to see 'Compiled successfully'.

To test stuff go to `localhost:5000/login` or `localhost:5000/welcome`
